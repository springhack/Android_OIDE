\begin{abstract}
\paragraph*{Background:}

Computer graphics for chemistry was established in the 50-ties, but not
until the 90-ties they become common place on the desktop; many dedicated
programs ... Closed-source, depending in specific hardware ...
Web browser posed additional restrictions on the use of accelerated
graphics; Java3D was not easily installed in browsers. Existing projects
were abondoned, such as Chime.

\paragraph*{Results:}

This paper describes the Open Source Jmol project and it's main product,
the Jmol graphical library, and it's applications in molecular graphics.

\paragraph*{Conclusions:}
The Jmol project has delivered ...
